# Improver-H 🚀

A Web3-powered loyalty and tipping platform for businesses and organizations.

The project is built specially for ETHKyiv2025 hackathon

## Overview

Improver-H is a cutting-edge B2B2C platform that transforms traditional customer loyalty programs by leveraging blockchain technology. Our platform helps businesses incentivize customer visits through an innovative bonus system and anonymous tipping mechanism, creating a more engaging and secure experience for both customers and merchants.

By combining the power of Web3 with practical business needs, we've created a solution that benefits everyone in the ecosystem. Customers enjoy a seamless experience with secure, private transactions, while businesses gain valuable insights and customer engagement tools. Our platform addresses key challenges in the loyalty program space:

- **Privacy & Security** 🔒: Using L2 privacy solutions to ensure complete anonymity for tips and secure transactions
- **Transparency** ✨: Leveraging blockchain technology for verifiable bonus point issuance and redemption
- **Cost Efficiency** 💰: Implementing gas-optimized solutions to keep operational costs minimal
- **User Experience** 🎯: Creating an intuitive interface for both customers and merchants
- **Web3 Accessibility** 🌐: Enabling users to interact with blockchain features through familiar OAuth providers (like Google), making the Web3 infrastructure completely transparent to non-crypto users

The platform consists of two main user types: customers and merchants, each benefiting from our unique Web3 infrastructure.
